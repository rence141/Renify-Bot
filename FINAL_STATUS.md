# ✅ Your Renify Bot is Ready!

## 🎉 Setup Complete!

Your `.env` file is created with your Discord token.

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE

Your Discord bot token was shared publicly in chat. While I've set it up for you to use, you should **consider resetting it** for security:

1. Go to: https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Select your bot
3. Click "Bot" → "Reset Token"
4. Update the `.env` file with the new token

## 🚀 How to Start Your Bot

### Quick Start (Recommended):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File START_BOT.ps1
```

This starts both Lavalink and the bot automatically!

### Manual Start:

**Terminal 1 - Lavalink:**
```powershell
cd renify_lavalink
java -jar Lavalink.jar
```

**Terminal 2 - Bot:**
```powershell
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\Renify_Bot
python renify_core.py
```
